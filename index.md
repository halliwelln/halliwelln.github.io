### Nicholas Halliwell

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Côte d'Azur, working on the WIMMICS team at Inria in Sophia Antipolis, France.

My field of research is Explainable Artificial Intellgience. More specifically, when using knowledge graph embeddings on the task of link prediction, my work is focused on generating embedding space explanations, allowing users with different levels of background knowledge to understand model predictions.
