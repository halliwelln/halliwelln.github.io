### Nicholas Halliwell

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Côte d'Azur, working on the WIMMICS team at Inria in Sophia Antipolis, France.

My field of research is Explainable Artificial Intellgience, and understanding the predictions of black box models. More specifically, when using knowledge graph embeddings on the task of link prediction, my work is focused on generating embedding space explanations allowing all users to understand the model with different levels of background knowledge.
