### Nicholas Halliwell

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Côte d'Azur, working on the WIMMICS team at Inria in Sophia Antipolis, France.

My research interests include understanding and interpreting the decisions made by black box machine learning models.

My PhD thesis involves constructing Knowledge Graph datasets with ground truth explanations, evaluating the quality of explanations generated by current methods, and proposing new methods for generating explanations.
